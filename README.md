# COVID-19 Effects on Texas Public School Education Performance

This project analyzes the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on STAAR (State of Texas Assessments of Academic Readiness) test scores across schools in Texas.

## Overview

- Examines STAAR test scores before and after the COVID-19 pandemic
- Focuses on core subjects: reading, science, social studies, and math
- Analyzes data across different ethnic groups: Hispanic, White, Black, and Asian students
- Covers the time period from 2019 to 2023

## Key Findings

1. All ethnic groups experienced a decline in test scores following the pandemic.
2. Math and Social Studies showed the most significant drops in performance.
3. Hispanic and Black students were disproportionately affected compared to White and Asian students.
4. There has been a gradual recovery in scores since 2021, but pre-pandemic levels have not yet been reached for most groups.

## Data Analysis

- Used school-level data from nearly 9,000 schools across 1,207 school districts
- Created stacked bar graphs to visualize score distributions by ethnicity and subject
- Performed t-tests to assess the statistical significance of score changes, particularly for Hispanic students in Math and Social Studies

## Conclusions

- The pandemic resulted in significant learning losses across all ethnic groups
- The impact was uneven, exacerbating existing educational inequities
- Recovery has been observed but is not uniform across all groups

## Recommendations

- Focus on improving Math and Social Studies curricula to address the most affected subjects
- Implement targeted interventions for Hispanic and Black students to close the widened achievement gap
- Continue monitoring and adapting educational strategies to support ongoing recovery
